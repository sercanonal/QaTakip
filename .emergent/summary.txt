<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
Ben Intertech şirketinde yazılım kalite güvence mühendisiyim. Yoğun olduğum zamanlarda işlerimi unutabiliyor veya karıştırailiyorum, bazen de tamamladığım bir işi tekrar yapmış oluyorum. Senden bir QA ya da bir Intertech çalışanı için işlerini takip edebileceği, çok profesyonel, kullanıcı dostu ve animasyonlu harika bir uygulama yapmanı istiyorum. Bunu MacBook'ta kullanacağım ve belki ofis ile paylaşacağım.

Later requirements added by user:
- A Smart Today View on the dashboard to prioritize tasks.
- Removal of email-based login in favor of a simpler, device-based identity system.
- The project must be stable and easy for other developers to set up without needing  or manual database installation (MongoDB was replaced with SQLite).
- A Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality for task management.
- An updated calendar view for daily stand-ups.
- A fix for non-working in-app notifications.
- An improved Daily Summary feature.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack QA Task Manager application built with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend using SQLite for storage (migrated from MongoDB). The application features a device-based authentication system (no email/password), a dashboard with a Smart Today View that highlights critical tasks, a Kanban board on the Tasks page for managing statuses via drag-and-drop, and a calendar view.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was simultaneously addressing two user requests:
    1.  **Fixing Broken Notifications:** In-app notifications were not functioning. The agent identified missing state and data fetching logic in  and overwrote the file with a fix.
    2.  **Improving Daily Summary:** The user requested a more useful summary for daily stand-ups. The agent added a new  endpoint to  and updated  to display this new summary.
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Agent Testing Done: N
- Which testing method agent to use? both
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Fix and test the in-app notification system. (P0)
- Issue 2: Verify the new Daily Summary feature is working as expected. (P0)
- Issue 3: A minor session issue was reported by the testing agent in the previous run () but was not investigated or fixed. This could impact user experience. (P1)

Issues Detail:
- Issue 1:
    - Attempted fixes: The agent has rewritten  to include the necessary logic for fetching and displaying notifications.
    - Next debug checklist:
        1.  Restart the services.
        2.  Manually test the notification flow: Create a task that should trigger a notification (e.g., a new task assigned or a status change).
        3.  Check the browser's developer console for any network errors related to fetching notifications from the  endpoint.
        4.  Verify the backend logs to ensure the  endpoint is being called and is returning the correct data.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: The notification system is a core feature for user engagement and task awareness. Fixing it will make the app more interactive and useful.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: both
    - Blocked on other issue: None

- Issue 2:
    - Attempted fixes: The agent has created a new backend endpoint  and updated the  to use it.
    - Next debug checklist:
        1.  Create tasks that were completed yesterday and tasks that are in progress for today.
        2.  Navigate to the Calendar page and select the current day.
        3.  Verify that the summary correctly displays Yesterday I completed... and Today I will work on... sections with the right tasks.
        4.  Check the network request to  and its response to ensure the backend logic is correct.
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This is a direct user request to make the app more useful for their daily workflow (stand-up meetings).
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Is recurring issue? N
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: both
    - Blocked on other issue: None

- Issue 3:
    - Attempted fixes: None. The issue was mentioned in a test report but not addressed.
    - Next debug checklist:
        1.  Review the  file to understand the context of the minor session issue.
        2.  Try to reproduce the issue by following the test steps. It likely relates to the app state being lost or not persisting correctly across page navigations or refreshes.
        3.  Inspect  and how the  is stored and retrieved from .
    - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: Session stability is critical for a smooth user experience. Fixing this will prevent users from being unexpectedly logged out or losing their context.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Is recurring issue? Y (It appeared in a test report)
    - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: frontend
    - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Complete the implementation of the notification and daily summary features.
  - Where to resume: The code has been written. The next step is to restart the services and begin testing both features thoroughly.
  - What will be achieved with this?: Fulfills the user's latest two feature requests.
  - Status: IN PROGRESS
  - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: both
  - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no explicit upcoming tasks, but based on the user's feedback, future work will focus on enhancing the app as a decision-support tool rather than adding complex features.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Kanban Board and Calendar Logic (Recently completed):**
  - Implemented a 4-column (Yapılacak, Devam Ediyor, Bloke, Tamamlandı) Kanban board with drag-and-drop in .
  - Updated the calendar in  to show tasks on the current day if they are In Progress, in addition to their due date.
- **Removed Made with Emergent Badge:** Used a  in  to reliably remove the platform-injected badge.
- **Bug Fix ():** Fixed a runtime error on the Settings page by adding a missing import in .
- **Database Migration (MongoDB to SQLite):** Replaced the entire MongoDB dependency with a file-based SQLite database () to make the project run without external services.  was completely rewritten for this.
- **Project Stabilization:** Pinned dependency versions in  and , created  files, and updated  for easy setup.
- **Authentication System Overhaul:** Migrated from an insecure email-based login to a secure, device-based authentication using a UUID stored in . This involved rewriting  and .
- **Akıllı Bugün Görünümü (Smart Today View):** Implemented a new dashboard component that intelligently highlights critical and overdue tasks.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- Issue 1: Minor session issue reported by  in  was not addressed. See All Pending/In progress Issue list for details.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, aiosqlite (for async SQLite), Pydantic
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI components,  (for Kanban)
- **Database:** SQLite (file-based)
- **Authentication:** Device-based using UUID stored in browser's .

**key DB schema**
- **Database:** SQLite
- **File Path:** 
  - **tasks:** 
  - **users:** 
  - **projects:** 
  - **categories:** 
  - **notifications:** 

**changes in tech stack**
- The entire data layer was migrated from **MongoDB (using motor)** to **SQLite (using aiosqlite)** to remove the dependency on an external database service.

**All files of reference**
- : Core application file. Contains all API endpoints and the logic for interacting with the SQLite database. Recently updated to add the  endpoint.
- : Main application layout containing the sidebar and header. Recently updated to add notification fetching and display logic.
- : The calendar view. Recently overwritten to display the new Daily Summary.
- : The Kanban board view, using .
- : Manages the device-based user session.
- : The SQLite database file.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  dependency might still be present in  even though the e-mail functionality was removed. It should be cleaned up to avoid unnecessary package installation.

**key api endpoints**
- : Creates a new user with just a name.
- : Checks if a user is registered for the current device ID.
- : Gets statistics for the dashboard.
- : Gets tasks for the Today Focus card.
- : Gets tasks for the daily stand-up summary.
- : Gets all tasks (used by Kanban board).
- : Updates a task, including its status via drag-and-drop.
- : Gets unread notifications for the user.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **No MongoDB:** The project now runs on SQLite. Do not attempt to connect to or use MongoDB. All database logic is in  using .
- **Device-Based Auth:** Authentication is handled by passing a  (a UUID from ) in API request headers. There are no passwords or emails.
- **Focus on Simplicity:** The user has repeatedly emphasized the need for a simple, clean, and professional UI that acts as a decision-support tool, not a complex project management suite like Jira. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity.
